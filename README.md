# Educational Projects

The following is the repository presenting a few projects, that I've done in educational purposes.

Most of them requires downloading aditional files and pasting them in the indicated directories.
The most important one is OpenCV library. It's included in order to avoid the necessity of building it with extended version.

There are *.vcxproj* files included in some projects, so that there is no need to edit project's include/lib paths or linker's additional dependencies, but it should be opened with Visual Studio (x64 platform, platform toolset: v143).

# required files:
 ### [OpenCV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141ez19xtF14xc8gNLjJqIGshlPxiVIEs/view?usp=sharing)
 - it should be pasted in the main repository directory.
 - the directory containing **.dll** file is still needed to be included to environment variables.
